## 1. 🌍 Introduction to Backend

Backend refers to the server-side of an application responsible for handling business logic, database interactions, authentication, and integration with external services.

It powers everything the user sees on the frontend and ensures data consistency, security, and scalability.

---

## 2. 🏗 Backend Architecture

### 2.1 Monolith

* All logic, routes, services, and data access layers are bundled in a single codebase.
* Easy to start but harder to scale and maintain as the codebase grows.

**Learn more:** [https://www.atlassian.com/microservices/microservices-architecture/microservices-vs-monolith](https://www.atlassian.com/microservices/microservices-architecture/microservices-vs-monolith)

### 2.2 Microservices

* Application is split into small, independent services.
* Each service handles a specific business capability.
* Communicate via HTTP/gRPC/Message Brokers.

**Learn more:** [https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/](https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/)

### 2.3 SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)

* Predecessor to microservices, similar but often uses enterprise protocols like SOAP.

---

## 3. 🔌 API Design and Communication

### 3.1 REST APIs

* Stateless architecture
* HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
* Resource-based URLs and JSON responses

**Resource:** [https://restfulapi.net/](https://restfulapi.net/)

### 3.2 GraphQL

* Single endpoint
* Flexible querying
* Ideal for frontend-heavy apps

**Resource:** [https://graphql.org/learn/](https://graphql.org/learn/)

### 3.3 gRPC

* High-performance, protocol buffer-based RPC framework
* Best for internal service communication

### 3.4 API Gateway

* Handles routing, authentication, rate-limiting, and logging

**Resource:** [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html)

---

## 4. ⚙️ Core Infrastructure Components

### 4.1 Load Balancer

* Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers
* Helps in fault tolerance and scalability

**Resource:** [https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/load-balancer/http-load-balancer/](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/load-balancer/http-load-balancer/)

### 4.2 Caching

* Temporary storage for frequently accessed data
* Tools: Redis, Memcached
* Strategies: Write-through, Write-back, Cache Aside

### 4.3 Rate Limiting

* Protects services from abuse
* Algorithms: Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket
* Tools: express-rate-limit (Node.js), nginx rate limiting

### 4.4 Cron Jobs

* Scheduled background tasks
* Linux `cron`, Node.js `node-cron`, AWS EventBridge

**Resource:** [https://crontab.guru/](https://crontab.guru/)

## 5. 🗃 Data Layer

### 5.1 Relational Databases

* Structured schema: MySQL, PostgreSQL
* ACID compliant

### 5.2 NoSQL Databases

* Schema-less: MongoDB, DynamoDB, Cassandra
* Useful for flexible and scalable data models

### 5.3 Database Design

* Normalization, Indexing, Query Optimization, Transactions

---

## 6. 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

* Session-based vs Token-based (JWT)
* OAuth2, OpenID Connect
* RBAC, ABAC access control models

---

## 7. 📈 Scalability & Performance

* Horizontal vs Vertical scaling
* Caching strategies
* Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)

---

## 8. 🚀 DevOps & Deployment

* CI/CD: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
* Docker & Kubernetes
* Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Pulumi

---

## 9. 🪵 Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting

* Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, ELK Stack
* Metrics, logs, traces (observability stack)

---

## 10. 🛡 Security Best Practices

* Input sanitization, validation
* HTTPS everywhere
* JWT secrets management
* OAuth2 flows and scopes

---
